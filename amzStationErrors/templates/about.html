    <strong>Subject:</strong> Concerns Regarding Work Rate Calculation and Performance Evaluation
  </p>
  <p>
    Dear SHV1 ICQA and Facility Management Staff,
  </p>
  <p>
    I am writing to formally express my concerns about the current methodology used to calculate work rates, as highlighted in my recent performance review and subsequent retraining. Approximately 2–3 weeks ago, I received feedback indicating an average rate of 300 items per shift, which has led to my placement on a two‑month probationary period. Since then, I have monitored my performance across shifts, consistently averaging between 450 and 500 items.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my review of recent shifts, I observed significant discrepancies. For instance, on March 30 I was informed of an 800+ item rate during my shift, whereas on March 31, 2025 my rate was reported as only 266 items.
  </p>
  <p>
    On Sunday, March 30th, I recall receiving totes during an 8‑hour shift that contained more than 100 items per tote. I further know that on the 30th I received one tote with over 400 items, another tote with over 500 items, and finally a tote that contained 973 items in a single tote.
  </p>
  <p>
    While on the 31st, I documented multiple periods where no totes arrived at my station. I believe you will discover that 85% of the totes that arrived at my station in a 4‑hour period contained Andon items such as unscannable barcodes, broken sets, or damaged items. While most totes holding countable items contained fewer than 5, I did not receive any tote on the 31st that contained more than 30–40 items. Most of the totes previously contained Andon issues, and the additional totes had only small sums of items available to count. Some delay intervals spanned up to two minutes before any new totes arrived at the station. These variations suggest the current performance algorithm may not accurately reflect the actual work supplied and completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have addressed these issues in discussions with members of ICQA management, including Edgar Hichez, Jorge Sosa, Mark Warner, Derrick Mullford, and Ally Muhamed. Although I was reassured that my record would be adjusted in two months, I remain concerned that the underlying data collection and reporting practices are flawed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that evaluating performance solely on a fixed average rate does not account for the inherent variability in tote volume and content, potentially leading to inaccurate assessments and undue concern. A more nuanced approach, perhaps one that considers the percentage of effective work completed, could more accurately reflect the actual workload.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also want to inquire about the efficiency and productivity of a cycle counter receiving more than 80% of their workload simply confirming andons in totes. Perhaps additional tote delivery behaviors could be programmed to avoid this waste of time, energy, productivity, and efficiency—such as marking totes containing andons so that they are not sent to counters.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have worked for Amazon now for over 6 months, and 4 months ago I made notes and presented to my management team how the SHV1 would benefit from additional system automations. It has been over 4 months, and I have not noticed any significant changes that have increased actual machine efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I am eager to work together to review these findings and adjust the evaluation process accordingly for a fairer assessment of performance.
  </p>
