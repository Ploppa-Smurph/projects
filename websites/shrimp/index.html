                <h4>Blue Dream shrimp facts:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blue Dream Shrimp are native to Taiwan and have become popular in the aquarium hobby due to their stunning blue color.</li>
                    <li>They are excellent algae eaters and help keep your tank clean by grazing on algae growth.</li> 
                    <li>Blue Dream Shrimp are social creatures and thrive in groups. Keeping them in a small colony enhances their well-being.</li> 
                    <li>These shrimp are sensitive to water quality, so regular water changes and proper filtration are essential for their health.</li> 
                    <li>Blue Dream Shrimp molt periodically to grow. During molting, they shed their exoskeleton and emerge with a fresh, vibrant color.</li> 
                    <li>They enjoy exploring their environment, especially if you provide hiding spots like driftwood, rocks, or plants.</li> 
                    <li>Blue Dream Shrimp are relatively peaceful and won‚Äôt bother other tank inhabitants.</li> 
                    <li>They exhibit interesting behaviors, such as cleaning their antennae and grooming their legs with their mouthparts.</li> 
                    <li>These shrimp are sensitive to sudden changes in water parameters, so gradual acclimation is crucial when introducing them to a new tank.</li> 
                    <li>Blue Dream Shrimp are a great addition to planted aquariums, as they graze on biofilm and algae growing on leaves and surfaces.</li>

                <h3>Black Rose Shrimp</h3>
                <p>Ebon Enchanters of the Hidden Nooks</p>
                <h4>Black Rose shrimp facts:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Black Rose Shrimp have shells with a strong black color, slightly darker than the brown Chocolate shrimp. They are selectively bred from the Chocolate morph until reaching almost pure black shells.</li> 
                    <li>An adult Black Rose Shrimp typically grows to a size of about 3 cm (1.2 inches).</li> 
                    <li>Their bodies are black with white spots, and their legs have black stripes.</li> 
                    <li>Black Rose Shrimp are not sexually dimorphic, meaning that males and females look alike.</li> 
                    <li>They thrive in aquariums of at least 5 gallons, but larger tanks are even better to maintain water quality.</li> 
                    <li>Water quality is crucial for Black Rose Shrimp. Regular water changes, stable temperature, and low nitrates are essential.</li> 
                    <li>They appreciate hiding places, such as live plants, moss balls, or shrimp tubes, to feel safe and secure.</li> 
                    <li>Black Rose Shrimp can coexist with small and peaceful microfish species as tankmates, but no fish is entirely shrimp-safe.</li> 
                    <li>These shrimp are hardy but still require high water quality. Stability is more important than exact water values.</li> 
                    <li>Black Rose Shrimp are a product of selective breeding from their ancestor, the Chocolate Shrimp, and do not have a natural habitat in the wild.</li>
