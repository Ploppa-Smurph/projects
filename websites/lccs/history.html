                    is our guiding principle at the Louisiana Christian Canine Sodality (LCCS). We believe that every wagging tail, every soulful gaze, and every joyful bark carries a divine spark. Our mission is to create a sacred space where pets and their owners come together, transcending denominational boundaries, to celebrate the Creator. Through prayer, fellowship, and acts of compassion, we honor the bond between humans and their furry companions, recognizing that in their presence, we glimpse the very heart of worship.

                    <b>In the heart of the bayou, where the Spanish moss drapes like ancient prayers, a fellowship unlike any other took root.</b>

                    The Louisiana Christian Canine Sodality (LCCS), affectionately known as “Licks,” emerged in 2018 as a unique fellowship uniting faith and fur. Their vision was simple: to intertwine the sacred and the furry, recognizing that dogs are vessels of divine joy. From Shreveport to Baton Rouge, believers and their faithful hounds gathered under open skies, where each gathering became a symphony of barks, laughter, and heartfelt prayers. Their mission extended beyond parks—they blessed neighborhoods, visited nursing homes, and provided aid during disasters. In this sacred space, denominations and breeds blended seamlessly, teaching forgiveness, loyalty, and boundless joy.

                    Communion at Licks was a moment when the veil between heaven and earth seemed thin. Dogs received their share—a treat, a morsel of grace—while humans bowed their heads. The slogan “for all denominations and breeds” became their anthem. Licks believed that when the final trumpet sounded, the dogs would lead the way to eternity. For in their eyes, they saw not just companions but fellow pilgrims on this wild journey of grace.
                    
                    Licks: where paws meet prayer, and every bark is an “Amen.”
