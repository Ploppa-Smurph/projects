    <h1>React 2022 freeCodeCamp / <b>Bob Ziroll</b> (Scrimba)</h1>
    <pre>My preceding notes have been erased and I will start notes again 1/3 through the 12 hour course.
    It has taken me over a week to get this far, but I have learned much and overcome many obstacles that I have come across.
    Currently at <a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=14138">in the video -- about to learn to Render Arrays in React</a>
    I will need to watch a course on CSS Flex, JavaScript Arrow Functions, JavaScript Map, and JavaScript DOM in order to more successfully complete this course and will complete these today (06/13/2022). 
        After completing the above lessons I will continue this React Course.
My project list in order is: 
        01 = reactInfo
        02 = shrimp2
        03 = airbnb
        03b = walleyworks02
        03c = walleyworks03
</pre>
<h2>React Mapping Components</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=14411">link to ep18 - Mapping Components in React</a>
<br>continuing work on <i>walleyworks2</i> the joke app
<br> worked with iterating over elements in an array and placing them into the HTML.
<h2>ep19 Map Quiz </h2> 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=14411s">link to episode</a>
<br>looking over .map() array method. 
<br>What does it do? -- returns a new array from the callback function provided & is placed at the same index in the new array.
<br><br>what do we use .map() for in React -- takes an array of raw data into an array of JSX elements that can be displaye on a webpage 
<br><br>why is using .map() better than just creating components manually? -- makes code more 'DRY' and self-sustaining not requiring additional changes whenever the data changes.

<h2>ep23 - Conditional Rendering -- Sold Out Badge</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=15538">link to video</a>
<br>Conditional Rendering = when you render something to the screen if a condition is met
<br> in React we use JavaScript (if statements, logic, and algorithms) inside code all the time --- conditional rendering is an example of that. 
<h2>ep24 - Pass Objects as props</h2>
<br>passed the information as a json object ('item' in the example) instead of having so many props in our App.jsx.
<h2>ep25 - Spread Object as Prop</h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=15539s">link to video</a>
<br>another way to pass an object is with "Object Spread Syntax"
<br> <i></i>
<br> we use the javaScript 'Spread' method to pass every property of the object as new single properties to the Card in our React program walleyworks3
<br> ex: instead of having <b>item={item}</b> we could 'spread' the item ex: <b>{...item}</b>
<h2>Solo Project 2 -- Travel Blog</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=16631">link to challange</a>
<br> I will make a travel site called Walley's World Tour a Walley Works Project
<br><br>End of Section 2 -- we Learned and used <b>Props</b> and <b>Mapping Data</b>
<h1>Section 03 -- ep01 Build a Meme Generator</h1>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=16899">link to video</a>
<br>Creating Interactive Web Apps in React -- in the first 2 examples we used React props to design Static Websites with Reusable Components
<br>we will now be interacting with the different elements of our website
<br><b>Static Web Page</b> -- Read only -- no change to data. Users don't interact, they only read.  <i>ex: blogs, news sites, recipes, etc</i> 
<br><b>Dynamic Web Page</b> -- Read and Write -- highly interactive, displays users data. <i>ex: social media, bank website, airbnb real site</i>
<ul> This lesson we will cover
    <li><b>Event Listeners</b></li>
    <li><b>State</b></li>
    <li><b>Conditional Rendering</b></li>
    <li><b>Forms</b></li>
    <li><b>Side Effects</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>ep02 Header for meme React project</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=17158">link to video</a>
<br>will be working in folder <i>meme</i> with that React project.
