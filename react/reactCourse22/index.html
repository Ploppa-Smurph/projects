    <h1>React 2022 freeCodeCamp / <b>Bob Ziroll</b> (Scrimba)</h1>
    <pre>My preceding notes have been erased and I will start notes again 1/3 through the 12 hour course.
    It has taken me over a week to get this far, but I have learned much and overcome many obstacles that I have come across.
    Currently at <a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=14138">in the video -- about to learn to Render Arrays in React</a>
    I will need to watch a course on CSS Flex, JavaScript Arrow Functions, JavaScript Map, and JavaScript DOM in order to more successfully complete this course and will complete these today (06/13/2022). 
        After completing the above lessons I will continue this React Course.
My project list in order is: 
        01 = reactInfo
        02 = shrimp2
        03 = airbnb
        03b = walleyworks02
        03c = walleyworks03
</pre>
