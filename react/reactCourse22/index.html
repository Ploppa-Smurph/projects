    this is going to be a long course and testing
    <br>re-watch lessons and redo challenges

    <h2>01 we will work on making static web pages with react -- the basics</h2>
    learning basic syntax and vocabulary of React. Declartive vs Imparitive programming.
    <br> JSX, custom components, css styling
    <br>project: <i>reactInfo</i>
    <pre>
    <br><br><b><pre><code>ReactDOM.render(&ltp&gtwords&ltp&gt, getElementById("root"))</code></pre></b>
        learned about ReactDOM.render
    <h2>part04: reactInfo app beginning</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=1035">link to part04 of video</a>
<br> Beginning of <i>reactInfo</i> app (app ex01)
<br> why use React -- we can write 'composable' code. --which means: we are making small maintainable and flexible parts to build the whole
<br> -- not just building the entire website as static.
<br><br> React uses className instead of class in the 'HTML' code -- ex: <b>&ltnav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"&gt</b>
<br>In React you create functions and you must <b>return()</b> the data == this creates the component -- it is the data contained in the named function. 
<br>ex:
<br><pre>
    function MainContent() {
        return (
            &lth1&gt React is awesome! &lt/h1&gt
        )
    }


    ReactDOM.render(
        &ltdiv&gt
            &ltMainContent /&gt
        &lt/div&gt,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )
</pre>
<h4>React is "Declarative"</h4>
React is a declarative language- We program React with what we want to get done. 
<br>with Imperative programming we must program every step along the way.
ex Imperative:
<pre>
    const h1 = document.createElement("h1")
    h1.textContent = "This is an Imperative way to program"
    h1.className = "header"
    document.getElementById("root").append(h1)
</pre>
ex Declarative:
<pre>
    ReactDOM.render(&lth1 className="header"&gtThis is a Declarative way to program&lth1&gt, getElementById("root"))
</pre>
<h2>Buidling a React info site -- JSX</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=1840">this point in Video</a>
<br>When using JavaScript vs React there are some differences -- console log shows that jsx creates: JSON like JavaScript Objects.
<h2>getting React info site project setup</h2>
in React JSX creates javascript objects (JSON) -- it is <b>'ReactDOM.render'</b> that takes the JSON and makes it usable in HTML
<h2>Markup for React info static page project</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=3000">start of project Markup</a>
<h2>Custom Components in React</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=3595">start of Custom Components</a>
a function that returns React elements is what we are looking at -- ex: <i><b>function TempName() {return(----jsx code written here---)}</b></i>
<br> Then when you <b><i>ReactDOM.render(&ltTempName /&gt, document.getElementById("root"))</i></b> it works like the constants we made in the earlier lessons
<ul>
    <li>Function name MUST be PascalCase (1st letter capitalized)</li>
    <li>to call the functions you MUST wrap it in angle brackets like HTML -- no parentheses after</li>
</ul>
When we create the <i><b>function Page()</b></i> we are creating a Parent component which then contains the children: <i><b>Header, MainContent, Footer</b></i>
<h2>Organize Components (React)</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=5125">start of Organize Components</a>
<br><br>When moving your components into their own .jsx file
<br> I'm unable to work with components in my 1st project, it may be due to the fact that I am working from the React CDN and not an actual project build
<br><br>You export the functions from their own files. ex: <b></b><i>export default function Header() {return(----jsx code written here---)}</i></b> would be saved as 'Header.jsx'
<br> In the index.jsx you then import the component: <b><i>import Header from "./Header"</i></b> (if the Header.jsx component file is in the same folder as the index.jsx file)
<br> Each separate .jsx component file needs to <b><i>import React from "react"</i></b> in order for them to be .jsx compatible.
<h2>Using Create React App</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=5594">Create React App video points</a>
Babel and Webpack -- makes sense of your code and makes React work in browsers.
<br><b>Create-React-App</b> is a tool that bundles the Babel and Webpack together to make it easy to work with on your desktop.
<br> *** Must have Node & NPM installed *** -- go into a working folder and type: <b><i>npx create-react-app app-name</i></b>
<br> The app will then be created in a new folder that named 'app-name'.  ** to create the app in the current folder type: '<b><i>npx create-react-app .</i></b>'
<br> <b>::marker</b> there is now a CSS pseudo-element <b><i>::marker</i></b> -- it will change the color and size of &ltli&gt bullets.
<br> ex: <b><i>nav-list > li::marker { attributes to change }</i></b>
<h2>Data-driven React project 3: AirBnb Experience Clone</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=8848">start point for project 3: AirBnb Experience Clone</a>
<br>Data-driven React - the site we worked on before were static and hardcoded -- we will now work with updating data and having a more fluid (or driven by the data) 
<ul>Learning this lesson
    <li>Props</li>
    <li>Create React components from array of data</li>
</ul>
trying <b>CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true</b> in package.json to get react project to auto-reload on change -- did not work.
<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=9870">time stamp to where I am in project</a>
<h4>work more on project 03 Walley Works (airbnb)</h4>
working on using dynamic data to propagate the data field in the app. 
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=10233">problem with non-reusable code</a>
<br><br> got the hot load issue resolved by moving the projects to my WSL '/home' directory
<br> loaded the files in WSL in VSCode, also -- now Hot Loading is working
<br> about to Start 'Props' in React to learn to input data into our code to create reusable template components?? 
<h2>Props in React - Start of Props</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=10350">start of Props with Bob Ziroll</a>
Props are similar to adding parameters to a function -- it allows the code to be a template that can dynamically change.
<br><br>Youtube search page, Amazon search pages and landing pages are full of reused components. 
<br>Tile / Card holds Thumbnail, Under that is a Title, the uploader is under that, and then views and when uploaded. 
<h4>overview</h4>
remember that in React we are working with JSX, not HTML. 
<br> to work with constants / variables in JSX remember to surround them in Curly Braces {} -- as I did with the images in the project - ex: called with {wwLogo}
<br>ex: <b>&lth1&gtHello {firstName}!&lt/h1&gt</b>
<br><br> ANYTHING that you put within curly braces in JSX will be run as JavaScript code.
<br><br> ex: <b>function App() {</b>
    <br><b>const date = new Date()</b>
    <br><b>return ( &gth1&ltIt is currently about {date.getHours() % 12} o'colock.&gt/h1&lt</b>
<br><b>ReactDOM.render(&gtApp /&lt, document.getElementById("root"))</b>
<br><br>you can simply do the JavaScript outside of the {} as a constant or variable
<br>ex: <b>const hours = date.getHours() % 12</b>
<br> then return <b><i>&gth1&ltIt is currently about {hours} o'clock.&gt/h1&lt</i></b>
<br> that way you seperate the logic from the display you can use recursive statements in the logic area (if-else statments and more)
<br> in order to bring the Properties (props) / parameters into the JSX we must add 'props' to the function parameter (props in this case, it can be any word you choose)
<br> if we have added properties to our imported Contact in the App.jsx (see ex: image, name, phone, email in App.jsx Contact section) 
<br><br> if we 'console.log(props)' in our Contact function then it displays (JSON format the img, name, phone, and email properties that we added to the App.jsx Contacts)
<br>cannot get web images to appear -- still must import images and src={wwLogo} and such for now -- not very helpful for dynamic coding 

<h3>Prop Quiz</h3>
1: what do props help accomplish?
<br><i>pass dynamic data to a static component -- like parameters for a function the props pass data to the React component. keep code as DRY as possible</i>
<br><br>2: How do you pass a prop into a component?
<br><i>ex: &ltCustomComponent name="Trelvyn" /&gt</i> etc... -- you add parameters to it's component in the App.jsx
<br><br>3: Can I pass a custom prop to a native DOM element? why or why not?
<br><i></i>No -- React turns the jsx elements into real DOM elements, we cannot add custom parameters to native dom elements... that is a benefit of React
<br><br>4: How do I receive props in a component?
<br><i></i> add the 'props' parameter / attribute to the custom function. ex: export default function Custom(props) {}
<br><br>5: What data type is 'props' when the component receives it?
<br><i>it is an Object and we can use .syntax to access it's properties</i>

<h2>Object Destructuring</h2>
Bob prefers to use the 'props' object and 'dot syntax'
<h2>Setup React App from Scratch, again -- last time he says</h2>
<a href="">link to this point in React video</a>
<br>in the reactCourse22 folder i type<b>npx create-react-app walleyworld2</b> == this creates a new folder in my 'reactCourse22' folder
<br> <b>cd walleyworld2 </b> to enter the newly created folder
<br>import react from react -- export default function Header() {return(h3Header/h3)} -- and such for each page to get it started -- importing style in the index.jsx file and app in the components folder with all the other components
