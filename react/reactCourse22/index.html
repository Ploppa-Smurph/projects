    <h1>React 2022 freeCodeCamp / <b>Bob Ziroll</b> (Scrimba)</h1>
    <pre>My preceding notes have been erased and I will start notes again 1/3 through the 12 hour course.
    It has taken me over a week to get this far, but I have learned much and overcome many obstacles that I have come across.
    Currently at <a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=14138">in the video -- about to learn to Render Arrays in React</a>
    I will need to watch a course on CSS Flex, JavaScript Arrow Functions, JavaScript Map, and JavaScript DOM in order to more successfully complete this course and will complete these today (06/13/2022). 
        After completing the above lessons I will continue this React Course.
My project list in order is: 
        01 = reactInfo
        02 = shrimp2
        03 = airbnb
        03b = walleyworks02
        03c = walleyworks03

<h2>React Mapping Components</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=14411">link to ep18 - Mapping Components in React</a>
<br>continuing work on <i>walleyworks2</i> the joke app
<br> worked with iterating over elements in an array and placing them into the HTML.
<h2>ep19 Map Quiz </h2> 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=14411s">link to episode</a>
<br>looking over .map() array method. 
<br>What does it do? -- returns a new array from the callback function provided & is placed at the same index in the new array.
<br><br>what do we use .map() for in React -- takes an array of raw data into an array of JSX elements that can be displaye on a webpage 
<br><br>why is using .map() better than just creating components manually? -- makes code more 'DRY' and self-sustaining not requiring additional changes whenever the data changes.

<h2>ep23 - Conditional Rendering -- Sold Out Badge</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=15538">link to video</a>
<br>Conditional Rendering = when you render something to the screen if a condition is met
<br> in React we use JavaScript (if statements, logic, and algorithms) inside code all the time --- conditional rendering is an example of that. 
<h2>ep24 - Pass Objects as props</h2>
<br>passed the information as a json object ('item' in the example) instead of having so many props in our App.jsx.
<h2>ep25 - Spread Object as Prop</h2>
