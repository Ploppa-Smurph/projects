<body>
    <h1>React 2022 freeCodeCamp / <b>Bob Ziroll</b> (Scrimba)</h1>
    <p>My preceding notes have been erased and I will start notes again 1/3 through the 12 hour course.
    It has taken me over a week to get this far, but I have learned much and overcome many obstacles that I have come across.
    Currently at <a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=14138">in the video -- about to learn to Render Arrays in React</a>
    I will need to watch a course on CSS Flex, JavaScript Arrow Functions, JavaScript Map, and JavaScript DOM in order to more successfully complete this course and will complete these today (06/13/2022). 
        After completing the above lessons I will continue this React Course.
My project list in order is: 
        01 = reactInfo
        02 = shrimp2
        03 = airbnb
        03b = walleyworks02
        03c = walleyworks03</p>
<h2>React Mapping Components</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=14411">link to ep18 - Mapping Components in React</a>
<br>continuing work on <i>walleyworks2</i> the joke app
<br> worked with iterating over elements in an array and placing them into the HTML.
<h2>ep19 Map Quiz </h2> 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=14411s">link to episode</a>
<br>looking over .map() array method. 
<br>What does it do? -- returns a new array from the callback function provided & is placed at the same index in the new array.
<br><br>what do we use .map() for in React -- takes an array of raw data into an array of JSX elements that can be displaye on a webpage 
<br><br>why is using .map() better than just creating components manually? -- makes code more 'DRY' and self-sustaining not requiring additional changes whenever the data changes.
<h2>ep20 putting it all together for Airbnb experience - walleyworks03</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=15015">link to video</a>
<h2>ep23 - Conditional Rendering -- Sold Out Badge</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=15538">link to video</a>
<br>Conditional Rendering = when you render something to the screen if a condition is met
<br> in React we use JavaScript (if statements, logic, and algorithms) inside code all the time --- conditional rendering is an example of that. 
<h2>ep24 - Pass Objects as props</h2>
<br>passed the information as a json object ('item' in the example) instead of having so many props in our App.jsx.
<h2>ep25 - Spread Object as Prop</h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=15539s">link to video</a>
<br>another way to pass an object is with "Object Spread Syntax"
<br> <i></i>
<br> we use the javaScript 'Spread' method to pass every property of the object as new single properties to the Card in our React program walleyworks3
<br> ex: instead of having <b>item={item}</b> we could 'spread' the item ex: <b>{...item}</b>
<h2>Solo Project 2 -- Travel Blog</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=16631">link to challange</a>
<br> I will make a travel site called Walley's World Tour a Walley Works Project
<br><br>End of Section 2 -- we Learned and used <b>Props</b> and <b>Mapping Data</b>
<h1>Section 03 -- ep01 Build a Meme Generator</h1>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=16899">link to video</a>
<br>Creating Interactive Web Apps in React -- in the first 2 examples we used React props to design Static Websites with Reusable Components
<br>we will now be interacting with the different elements of our website
<br><b>Static Web Page</b> -- Read only -- no change to data. Users don't interact, they only read.  <i>ex: blogs, news sites, recipes, etc</i> 
<br><b>Dynamic Web Page</b> -- Read and Write -- highly interactive, displays users data. <i>ex: social media, bank website, airbnb real site</i>
<ul> This lesson we will cover
    <li><b>Event Listeners</b></li>
    <li><b>State</b></li>
    <li><b>Conditional Rendering</b></li>
    <li><b>Forms</b></li>
    <li><b>Side Effects</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>ep02 Header for meme React project</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=17158">link to video</a>
<br>will be working in folder <i>meme</i> with that React project.
<h2>ep04 EventListeners and Functionality in JavaScript</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=17835">link to EventListeners in Meme Slinger</a>
<br>we will use an API to retreive the Meme Image. We will return an array of the top 100 images at the time and will be able to sling the images from the array.  
<br>The main difference between a 'web site' and a 'web app' is that an app can be interacted with by the users.
<br><br>In React we add event listeners similar to how we would in HTML -- by adding 'onClick' in the object (notice the camelCase)[in HTML it is simply 'onclick']
<br>with React we will follow camelCase naming conventions -- 'onClick', 'onMouseOver', 'onMouseEnter'
<br>the React Documentation has a writeup of all the <b>'onMouse...'</b> events we can listen for in React -- Mouse Events will be 90%+ of the events we listen for in web apps
<h2>ep07 Updating Variables to Change UI Elements with React</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=18616">link to video</a>
mapping over arrays to add elements to the HTML page:
<pre><b>
    function App() {
        const thingsArray = ["Thing 1", "Thing 2"]

        // this maps through and also asigns a unique key to each
        const thingsElement = thingsArray.map(thing =&gt &ltp key={thing}&gt{thing}&lt/p&gt)

        return (
            &ltdiv&gt
            &ltbutton&gt Add Item &lt/button&gt
            {thingsElement}
            &lt/div&gt
        )
    }
</b></pre>
Add an event listener to the button so that it 
<pre><b>
    function App() {
        const thingsArray = ["Thing 1", "Thing 2"]

        // this maps through and also asigns a unique key to each
        const thingsElement = thingsArray.map(thing =&gt &ltp key={thing}&gt{thing}&lt/p&gt)

        // add item function
        function addItem() {
            const newThing = `Thing ${thingsArray.length + 1}`
            thingsArray.push(newThing)
        }

        return (
            &ltdiv&gt
            &ltbutton onClick={addItem}&gt Add Item &lt/button&gt
            {thingsElement}
            &lt/div&gt
        )
    }
</b></pre>
As our code is written currently it is not auto-updating the elements on the HTML page
<br>The major benefit of using a 'Declarative' library is that all we need to do is update our data and React will update our UI.
<br> We Need to access React State.
<br><br> An example of a change of 'state' in React is liking a photo or product on a website, expanding details on a picture or slide on a website, etc...
<br> Here is the same code with the 'state' information added so that the app does now function correctly
<pre><b>
    function App() {
        const thingsArray = ["Thing 1", "Thing 2"]
        const thingsElement = thingsArray.map(thing =&gt &ltp key={thing}&gt{thing}&lt/p&gt)

        // Update the 'State'
        function addItem() {
            const newThing = `Thing ${thingsArray.length + 1}`
            setThings(prevState =&gt [...prevState, newThingText])
        }

        const thingsElement = things.map(thing =&gt &ltp key={thing}&gt{thing}&lt/p&gt)

        return (
            &ltdiv&gt
                &ltbutton onClick={addItem}&gt Add Item &lt/button&gt
                {thingsElement}
            &lt/div&gt
        )
    }
</b></pre>
<br><b>Props vs States</b>
<br><b><i>Props</i></b> are 'properties' passed into a component in order for it to work correctly. The props received by components are 'immutable'.
<br><br><b><i>States</i></b> are 'values' managed by the component, similar to variables declared inside a function. 
<br> Any Time you are changing values that will be displayed/saved, you'll likely be using state.
ex:<pre><b>
    function greeting(name) {
        const date = new Date()
        const hours = date.getHours()

        let timeOfDay
        if(hours >= 4 && hours < 12) {
            timeOfDay = "morning"
        } else if(hours >= 12 && < 17>) {
            timeOfDay = "afternoon"
        } else if(hours >= 17 && hours < 20) {
            timeOfDay = "evening"
        } else {
            timeOfDay = "night"
        }

        return `Good ${timeOfDay}, ${name}!`
    }

    console.log(greeting("Jeffy"))
</b></pre>
<ul>
    <li>State is a way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
    <li>Props are for passing data into a component 
    <li>State is used to hold values (and 'remember' those values even when React re-renders a component)
    <li>Imutable items are unchangeable -- Props are immutable, State is mutable
</ul>
<h2>ep11 Implementing 'useState'</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=19934">link to spot in video (about 5:30 / 12)</a>
We have to be comfortable with 'state' in React (and all programming)
<br><b>.useState()</b> is a React Hook! ex: <b>React.useState()</b>
<br>It is very common to see the import Destructure the method. ex:
<pre><b>
    import React, {useState} from "react"

    export default function App(
        useState()
        return (
            ...
        )
    )
</b></pre>
Bob will stick with the 'React.useState()' for this project so it is easier to visualize where the method is coming from 
<br><b>CHECK THIS OUT!!</b>
<br>when we use '.useState()' it returns the input we enter in an array, and a function. if we leave the parameter empty it will return '"undefined", f()'
<br>below we assign the 'result' variable parameter to "Yes" and call it in the return below with {result[0]}
<pre><b>
    import React, {useState} from "react"

    export default function App(
        useState()
        return (
            const result = React.useState("Yes")
            
            return (
                &ltdiv className="state"&gt
                    &lth1 className="state-title"&gtState is IMPORTANT&lth1&gt
                    &ltdiv className="state-value"&gt
                        &lth1&gt{result[0]}&lt/h1&gt
                    &lt/div&gt
                &lt/div&gt        
            )
        )
    )
</b></pre>
this is a clunky way of doing it and we will learn a better way in the next example
<h4>useState Array Destructuring</h4>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=20169">link to video</a>
<p>What we get back when we useState() is an array with the first value saved as the state we are saving. A better way of doing it is by 'Destructuring the Array' that we can more easily retrieve the result.</p>
<p>I need to look into Array Destructuring in javascript.
    <br>the example below returns "Yes" (without the ', f()') -- it has been destructured
</p>
<pre><b>
    import React from "react"

    export default function App(
        // Destructuring of the Array ** a common standard is to name the function 'set' + the name of the state
            // so in this example the state is named 'isImportant' and the function is 'setIsImportant'
        const [isImportant, setIsImportant] = React.useState("Yes")
        return ( 
                &ltdiv className="state"&gt
                    &lth1 className="state-title"&gtState is IMPORTANT&lth1&gt
                    &ltdiv className="state-value"&gt
                        &lth1&gt{isImportant}&lt/h1&gt
                    &lt/div&gt
                &lt/div&gt        
        )
    )
</b></pre>
When working with state we cannot simply change set and change a variable, we use the built in 'func' ('f()' in the array) to change the state.
